# IQ Session Plugin Build Log — 2025-10-27

## Overview
- Added the `iq-plugin` crate that hosts `IQSessionPlugin`, a Jetstreamer plugin which filters Solana transactions for IQ Labs session PDAs, parses chunk/finalize instructions, reconstructs uploaded payloads, and POSTs them to the reader backend.
- Introduced the `iq_runner` binary so Jetstreamer can derive slot ranges (from explicit specs or by discovering signature bounds for session PDAs) and execute the plugin inside the standard runner harness.
- Enabled environment-driven configuration via `iq-plugin/.env` and a helper script so OpenSSL/LLVM paths, reader endpoints, ClickHouse mode, and optional logging toggles can be managed without editing shell profiles.
- Added CLI helpers under `scripts/` to streamline shell setup and per-session replays, including automatic RPC selection and slot padding defaults.

## Components Added or Updated
- `iq-plugin/src/iq_session_plugin.rs`: Core plugin implementation. Key responsibilities:
  - Loads configuration from the environment (`IQ_PROGRAM_ID`, `IQ_SESSION_PDA_LIST`, reader mode, backend endpoint).
  - Filters transactions either by the configured program id or the tracked PDA list.
  - Parses Pinocchio or legacy chunk/finalize layouts (automatic fallback when `IQ_READER_MODE=passthrough`).
  - Buffers chunks per session in a `BTreeMap`, reorders them by `chunk_index`, and only emits when the expected total count is reached.
  - Sends a JSON payload to `${IQ_READER_BASE_URL}/${IQ_READER_ENDPOINT_PATH}` and logs success/failure.
- `iq-plugin/src/bin/iq_runner.rs`: Runner wiring and slot discovery.
  - Accepts `--session-pda` (comma-delimited) to auto-discover min/max slots via `getSignaturesForAddress`.
  - Supports manual `SLOT_SPEC` (range `start:end` or raw epoch id).
  - Exposes tuning flags: `--slot-padding`, `--max-signature-pages`, `--threads`, `--log-level`.
- `iq-plugin/.env`: Centralised config example. Includes:
  - Reader settings (program id, session filters, reader mode, base URL, endpoint path).
  - Jetstreamer tunables (`JETSTREAMER_THREADS`, `JETSTREAMER_CLICKHOUSE_MODE`, `JETSTREAMER_CLICKHOUSE_DSN`).
  - Toolchain paths resolved via Homebrew so `librocksdb-sys` and `libclang` builds succeed.
- `scripts/iq-env.sh`: Must be sourced; exports OpenSSL/LLVM paths, then loads `iq-plugin/.env` with `set -a` so all key/value pairs become exported environment variables.
- `scripts/run-session.sh`: Wrapper that sources `iq-env.sh`, takes a session PDA (or comma-separated list), and runs `cargo run -p iq-plugin --bin iq_runner --release`. Extra runner flags can be appended after the PDA argument.

## Typical Workflow
1. Start the IQ Labs backend locally so `IQ_READER_BASE_URL` resolves (defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).
2. In a new shell, run `source scripts/iq-env.sh` to export Homebrew toolchain paths and plugin environment variables.
3. Replay a session: `scripts/run-session.sh <SESSION_PDA> --slot-padding 200 --max-signature-pages 100`.
   - The script pins `--rpc-url` to `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`; override by passing `--rpc-url` explicitly.
   - Slot discovery queries up to `--max-signature-pages`*1 000 signatures per PDA, then pads the range by `--slot-padding` on both ends before launching Jetstreamer.
4. Jetstreamer streams the padded slot window from Old Faithful’s firehose, the plugin reconstructs the file, and a final log line reports the upload result: `uploaded session ... (chunks, bytes) to <endpoint>`.

## Observability & Troubleshooting
- Enable verbose logging by exporting `RUST_LOG=iq_plugin=debug` (either add to `.env` or prepend to the `cargo run` invocation). Debug logs enumerate every processed transaction so you can confirm chunk coverage.
- If the plugin reports `sessions still buffered at shutdown`, widen the padding or raise `--max-signature-pages`—missing chunk transactions usually sit just outside the initial slot window.
- The `.env` uses command substitution (e.g. `$(brew --prefix ...)`); sourcing through `scripts/iq-env.sh` ensures these are resolved before export. Running `cargo run` in a fresh shell without sourcing the helper will skip toolchain vars and can trigger `libclang.dylib` linkage failures.
- ClickHouse defaults to remote mode (`JETSTREAMER_CLICKHOUSE_MODE=remote`), so make sure a service is listening at `JETSTREAMER_CLICKHOUSE_DSN` (or flip the env back to `embedded` to reuse Jetstreamer’s bundled instance).

## Open Questions / Next Steps
- Consider baking default `--slot-padding` and `--max-signature-pages` into `scripts/run-session.sh` (currently only passed when specified on the command line due to the `exec` boundary).
- Decide whether to ship a lightweight supervisor for the remote ClickHouse helper alongside this repo (documentation references it, but an actual service stub is outside the tree).
- Add automated tests or fixtures for chunk parsing, especially around mixed legacy/pinocchio sessions, to guard against schema drift in IQ Labs’ on-chain program.
